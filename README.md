# Pokémon Legends: Arceus – Pokedex Tracker

This project automates the process of identifying which Pokémon you have not yet captured in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* by using OCR to read screenshots from your Pokédex. It also helps organize uncaught Pokémon by region and sub-location for efficient tracking and exploration.

## 🔧 Features

- 📸 **Screenshot OCR** using Tesseract and PyTesseract
- 🧠 **Master Pokédex Parsing** from guidebook data
- ❌ **Uncaught Pokémon Detection** based on your current caught list
- 🌍 **Web Interface** to filter uncaught Pokémon by region and sub-location
- 🕹️ Built with Python (backend) and React + Vite + TailwindCSS (frontend)
